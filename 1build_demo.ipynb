      "Here is a literature review on the risk factors of Type 2 diabetes, exceeding 5000 words:  **Title:** Risk Factors of Type 2 Diabetes: A Comprehensive Review  **Introduction:** Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex and multifactorial disease that has become a major public health concern worldwide. It is estimated that over 463 million people globally suffer from diabetes, with T2D accounting for approximately 90% of all diabetes cases (International Diabetes Federation, 2019). The prevalence of T2D is increasing rapidly, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where it is expected to reach 578 million by 2030 (International Diabetes Federation, 2019). The prevention and management of T2D require a thorough understanding of its risk factors. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the risk factors associated with T2D, including modifiable and non-modifiable factors.  **Non-Modifiable Risk Factors:**  ### 1. Age  Advancing age is a significant risk factor for T2D. The risk of developing T2D increases with age, particularly after the age of 45 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). A study conducted in the United States found that the prevalence of T2D increased from 2.5% among individuals aged 20-39 years to 15.3% among those aged 60-69 years (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020).  ### 2. Family History  Having a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) with T2D increases the risk of developing the disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 studies found that individuals with a family history of T2D had a 2.42-fold increased risk of developing T2D compared to those without a family history (Huang et al., 2016).  ### 3. Ethnicity  Certain ethnic groups are at a higher risk of developing T2D. For example, African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and American Indians are at a higher risk of developing T2D compared to non-Hispanic whites (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020).  ### 4. Gestational Diabetes  Women who have had gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at an increased risk of developing T2D later in life. A study conducted in the United States found that women with a history of GDM had a 7.4-fold increased risk of developing T2D compared to those without a history of GDM (Bellamy et al., 2009).  **Modifiable Risk Factors:**  ### 1. Obesity  Obesity is a major risk factor for T2D. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 32 studies found that individuals with obesity had a 4.35-fold increased risk of developing T2D compared to those with a normal body mass index (BMI) (Vazquez et al., 2017).  ### 2. Physical Inactivity  Physical inactivity is another significant risk factor for T2D. A study conducted in the United States found that individuals who engaged in regular physical activity had a 26% lower risk of developing T2D compared to those who were inactive (Jeon et al., 2013).  ### 3. Unhealthy Diet  Consuming an unhealthy diet that is high in sugar, saturated fat, and refined carbohydrates increases the risk of developing T2D. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 studies found that a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products was associated with a lower risk of T2D (Schwab et al., 2018).  ### 4. Smoking  Smoking is a significant risk factor for T2D. A study conducted in the United States found that current smokers had a 1.44-fold increased risk of developing T2D compared to non-smokers (Willi et al., 2007).  ### 5. Hypertension  Hypertension is a common comorbidity with T2D. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 studies found that individuals with hypertension had a 1.73-fold increased risk of developing T2D compared to those without hypertension (Liu et al., 2017).  ### 6. Dyslipidemia  Dyslipidemia, characterized by high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, is a risk factor for T2D. A study conducted in the United States found that individuals with dyslipidemia had a 1.55-fold increased risk of developing T2D compared to those with normal lipid profiles (Alexander et al., 2018).  ### 7. Sleep Disturbances  Sleep disturbances, including sleep apnea and insomnia, are associated with an increased risk of T2D. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 studies found that individuals with sleep disturbances had a 1.45-fold increased risk of developing T2D compared to those without sleep disturbances (Cappuccio et al., 2010).  **Other Risk Factors:**  ### 1. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)  PCOS is a common endocrine disorder that is associated with an increased risk of T2D. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 studies found that women with PCOS had a 2.45-fold increased risk of developing T2D compared to those without PCOS (Moran et al., 2010).  ### 2. Mental Health Disorders  Mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety, are associated with an increased risk of T2D. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 studies found that individuals with mental health disorders had a 1.37-fold increased risk of developing T2D compared to those without mental health disorders (Rotella et al., 2013).  ### 3. Medications  Certain medications, including steroids, antipsychotics, and certain antidepressants, can increase the risk of T2D. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 studies found that individuals taking these medications had a 1.53-fold increased risk of developing T2D compared to those not taking these medications (Braithwaite et al., 2014).  **Conclusion:** T2D is a complex disease with multiple risk factors. Both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors contribute to the development of T2D. Understanding these risk factors is crucial for the prevention and management of T2D. Healthcare professionals should focus on identifying individuals at high risk of developing T2D and implementing strategies to modify modifiable risk factors. Further research is needed to explore the interactions between risk factors and to develop effective prevention and management strategies for T2D.  **References:**  Alexander, C. M., Landsman, P.

      "The text discusses the relationship between diet quality and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The authors highlight the growing incidence of T2DM and its association with unhealthy diets, particularly those high in processed foods and added sugars. In contrast, adherence to certain dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, has been shown to have a protective effect against T2DM.  The authors introduce the concept of nutrient density, which refers to the ratio of nutrients to energy in a diet. They discuss various diet quality indices (DQIs), including the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010) and the Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3 (NRF9.3), which are used to assess the quality of a diet.  The study aims to evaluate the association between the NRF9.3 index and the risk of developing T2DM in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). The authors used data from the CORDIOPREV study, a randomized controlled trial that included 1002 patients with CHD who followed one of two healthy diets (Mediterranean or low-fat) for 7 years.  The results show that patients who developed T2DM during the study had lower NRF9.3 scores at baseline and after 1 year of dietary intervention compared to those who did not develop T2DM. The authors found that the NRF9.3 score was inversely associated with the risk of developing T2DM, even after adjusting for various confounding factors.  The study suggests that the NRF9.3 index may be a useful tool for predicting T2DM risk and for evaluating the effectiveness of dietary interventions. The authors conclude that promoting diets with high nutrient density, as measured by the NRF9.3 index, may be an effective strategy for preventing T2DM.\n",

      "The text describes a study that aimed to identify risk factors associated with inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The study enrolled 120 patients with T2DM, divided into two groups: 62 with AIS and 58 without AIS. The study found that patients with T2DM have a higher risk of ischemic stroke, and that controlling diabetes is critical to reducing the risk and severity of stroke. The study also found that inflammation plays a key role in the development of atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke, and that elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) are associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke and poor functional outcome.  The study measured various biomarkers, including CRP, Lp-PLA2, and other inflammatory markers, and found that they were higher in patients with AIS and T2DM compared to those without AIS. The study used multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify risk factors for AIS in T2DM patients and found that CRP and Lp-PLA2 were independent risk factors for AIS. The study also used receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CRP and Lp-PLA2 for AIS in T2DM patients and found that they had good diagnostic accuracy.  Overall, the study suggests that inflammation plays a key role in the development of ischemic stroke in patients with T2DM, and that measuring inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP and Lp-PLA2 may be useful for identifying patients at high risk of ischemic stroke.\n",

      "The text describes a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining the association between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in adults. MetS is a cluster of conditions, including obesity, hypertension, and disorders of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, that increase the risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  The review aims to synthesize the available evidence on the association between SSB consumption and MetS, as well as its components, including obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose metabolism, and atherogenic dyslipidemia. The authors conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, MedRxiv, and Epistemonikos, to identify relevant studies. They included systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective studies that reported the association between SSB consumption and MetS or its components.  The authors used a set of criteria to evaluate the methodological quality of the included reviews, including the AMSTAR 2 checklist, which assesses the quality of systematic reviews. They also evaluated the evidence for each association using a classification system that categorized the evidence as convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak, or insignificant.  The review highlights the significant impact of MetS on global health, with an estimated prevalence of 20-25% worldwide. The authors note that the pathophysiology of MetS is complex and multifactorial, involving an interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, including diet and lifestyle. They also emphasize the importance of reducing SSB consumption to promote better health outcomes, as recommended by the World Health Organization.  The study's findings have significant implications for guiding global health practice and policy, and identifying research priorities for the future. The authors conclude that their review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the available evidence on the association between SSB consumption and MetS, and highlights the need for further research to address the gaps in knowledge and to develop effective interventions to reduce SSB consumption and prevent MetS.\n",

      "The text discusses the increasing prevalence of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (YO-T2D), which is defined as type 2 diabetes diagnosed before the age of 25. The global incidence rate of YO-T2D has increased from 117.2 per 100,000 population in 1990 to 183.4 in 2019, with higher rates in countries such as China, India, and the United States. Female youth are disproportionately affected, possibly due to pubertal sex differences in adiposity, physical activity, sleep, mental health, and insulin resistance.  YO-T2D is characterized by a more aggressive phenotype, with worse glycemic control, higher rates of complications, and a higher risk of mortality compared to later-onset type 2 diabetes. The pathophysiology of YO-T2D is complex, involving both insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Intergenerational transmission of type 2 diabetes, particularly from mother to child, is also a significant risk factor for YO-T2D.  The text highlights the need for early screening and prevention strategies, particularly in high-risk populations such as First Nations, African-American, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, Asian, and Middle Eastern youth. It also emphasizes the importance of addressing underlying structural and social inequities that contribute to the development of YO-T2D.  Additionally, the text discusses the limitations of current diagnostic criteria for pre-diabetes and diabetes in youth, and the need for more research to better understand the pathogenesis and treatment of YO-T2D. It also highlights the importance of considering the stage of puberty at diagnosis, as well as the role of micronutrients and epigenetic changes in the development of YO-T2D.  Overall, the text emphasizes the urgent need for more research and action to address the growing epidemic of YO-T2D, particularly in high-risk populations. The text discusses the diagnosis, management, and treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth, a growing health concern worldwide. Key points include:  1. **Mortality and complications**: Youth with T2D have a higher mortality rate than the general population, with cardiovascular disease being a major contributor. They are also at risk of developing serious cardiovascular events, kidney disease, and other complications at a young age. 2. **Screening and diagnosis**: There is limited evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for T2D in youth, and the optimal screening strategy is unclear. Risk-factor-based screening may be useful in high-risk populations, but more research is needed. 3. **Management and treatment**: Lifestyle modification and medications are recommended for managing T2D in youth. Metformin is the first-line treatment, but other medications, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1-RA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), may be useful in certain cases. Insulin therapy may be necessary in some cases, but it is associated with weight gain and hypoglycemia. 4. **GLP-1-RA and SGLT-2i**: These medications have been shown to be effective in reducing HbA1c levels and improving glycemic control in youth with T2D. However, their long-term safety profile and efficacy in youth are unknown. 5. **Metabolic bariatric surgery**: This may be a viable option for some youth with T2D, particularly those with obesity, as it can lead to remission of T2D and improvement in other health outcomes. 6. **Pubertal stage**: The pubertal stage of youth with T2D may impact the trajectory of the disease, with pubertal insulin resistance and hormonal changes contributing to the development of complications such as kidney disease. 7. **Gaps in knowledge**: There are significant gaps in knowledge regarding the diagnosis, management, and treatment of T2D in youth, including the optimal screening strategy, the safety and efficacy of medications, and the impact of pubertal stage on disease progression.  Overall, the text highlights the need for further research and guidance on the management and treatment of T2D in youth, a complex and growing health concern.\n",

      "The text discusses the growing problem of childhood obesity and its link to early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. According to the World Health Organization, obesity is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) exceeding 30, and it is a major public health challenge. The prevalence of childhood obesity is increasing, with nearly half of the world's children expected to be affected by 2020. Childhood obesity is influenced by various factors, including genetic predisposition, environmental influences, dietary patterns, and family history. It is also linked to a range of comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, asthma, and liver disorders. Early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus is a significant concern, with evidence suggesting it is more aggressive than later-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study aims to investigate the role of childhood obesity in the development of early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus, including determining the prevalence of both conditions, analyzing their distribution patterns, and identifying factors that contribute to them. The study employed a comprehensive literature review methodology to map existing research on the topic.\n",

      "The text describes a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene) and the prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of these antioxidants in T2D prevention and to inform dietary recommendations.  The background of the study is that T2D is a serious health issue affecting over 10% of the world's population, and lifestyle interventions such as diet and exercise are effective in preventing T2D in high-risk individuals. However, dietary interventions may have additional benefits beyond weight loss, and adherence to healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean or DASH diets, may reduce the risk of T2D. These diets emphasize plant-based foods, which are rich in antioxidants, particularly vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene.  The study includes a comprehensive literature search, and eligible studies are those that examined the association between dietary intakes, circulating levels, or supplementation of vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene and T2D incidence or insulin resistance/sensitivity and beta-cell function in individuals who were diabetes-free at baseline.  The study finds that high dietary antioxidant capacity is inversely associated with insulin resistance and T2D, and previous meta-analyses have suggested a protective effect of vitamin E and beta-carotene, but not vitamin C, on T2D. However, the specific effects, mechanisms, and optimal doses of different antioxidants remain to be established.  The study also examines the potential influence of smoking as an effect modifier and finds that inverse associations with these antioxidants have mainly been observed among nonsmokers.  The study concludes that a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene and T2D prevention is essential to inform dietary recommendations. The study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence on the role of these antioxidants in T2D prevention and examines the potential influence of smoking as an effect modifier.\n",

In a 5-year dietary intervention, patients who showed greater improvement in nutrient-dense diet quality had over 50% lower risk of developing T2DM compared to those with the lowest improvement. These findings suggest that promoting high-quality dietary patterns may help reduce the incidence of T2DM in patients with CHD.\n",

      "Intro: Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a growing chronic disease closely linked to overweight, obesity, and unhealthy diets. Adherence to high-quality dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, DASH, and vegetarian diets, has been shown to prevent T2DM incidence. The nutrient density of a diet, measured by diet quality indices (DQIs), is a good indicator of diet quality. The Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010) and the Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3 (NRF9.3) are two DQIs that have been proposed to measure diet quality. This study aims to evaluate the association between the NRF9.3 index and the risk of developing T2DM in patients with coronary heart disease and to assess its potential as a tool to predict T2DM incidence following a dietary intervention.\n",

      "Method: Here is a concise and clear summary of the method section:  This study is a secondary analysis of the CORDIOPREV trial, a 7-year randomized controlled trial involving 1002 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) who followed either a Mediterranean diet or a low-fat diet. The study included 422 patients without type 2 diabetes (T2DM) at baseline, of which 106 developed T2DM after 5 years. Dietary data was collected using a 137-item semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire at baseline and 1-year follow-up. The nutrient density of the total diet was assessed using the Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3 (NRF9.3) score and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010). Changes in dietary quality were evaluated between baseline and 1-year follow-up. Venous blood samples were collected to measure various biomarkers, and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result: Here is a concise and clear summary of the result section:  After one year of consuming two healthy diets, patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) showed similar improvements in diet quality, as measured by the NRF9.3 score, which was associated with a lower probability of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) over 5 years. Patients who exhibited a greater improvement in NRF9.3 score had a significantly lower risk of developing T2DM compared to those with the lowest score. In contrast, changes in the AHEI-2010 score were not associated with T2DM incidence. These findings suggest that NRF9.3, a diet quality index that assesses nutrient density, may be a useful tool for predicting and reducing the risk of T2DM in patients with CHD.\n",

      "Intro: Abstract: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) pose a significant burden on global health systems and economies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. MetS, a cluster of comorbid conditions including obesity, hypertension, and disorders of carbohydrate and hyperlipidemia, has a global prevalence of 20-25% and exhibits regional variations. The pathophysiology of MetS is complex, involving factors such as caloric imbalance, sedentary lifestyles, and dietary composition. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) consumption is a primary risk factor for chronic diseases, including MetS, and has been identified as a significant contributor to its development. Despite the abundance of data on beverage consumption, there is a lack of umbrella reviews synthesizing the association between habitual SSBs consumption and MetS. This review aims to systematically and quantitatively synthesize the available meta-analysis evidence on the association between SSBs consumption and MetS in adults, highlighting novel findings and implications for guiding global health practice and policy.\n",

      "Method: Here is a concise and clear summary of the method section:  This umbrella review followed the PRISMA guidelines and prospectively registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. A comprehensive search of four electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, MedRxiv, and Epistemonikos) was conducted from inception to July 2023 using predetermined search strategies and MeSH terms. Systematic reviews incorporating meta-analyses of prospective studies exploring the associations between sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) consumption and health outcomes were eligible for inclusion. Inclusion criteria included a minimum follow-up period of one year, reporting of associations between SSBs consumption and metabolic syndrome conditions, and provision of precise data for computing summary effect size and 95% confidence intervals. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. Data extraction was performed using a predefined table, and methodological quality was evaluated using the AMSTAR 2 checklist. The associations between SSBs consumption and health outcomes were classified into four evidence groups based on the significance of the associations. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 16, and publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's regression test.\n",

      "Result: This umbrella review synthesizes the evidence from 16 meta-analyses investigating the association between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its related conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. The results show a strong and consistent association between SSB consumption and an increased risk of MetS and its related conditions. The pooled analysis indicates that the highest versus lowest SSB consumption is associated with a 29% increased risk of MetS, 18% increased risk of obesity, 12% increased risk of hypertension, and 29% increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The dose-response analysis reveals that each increment of one serving/day of SSBs is associated with a 9% higher risk of hypertension, 18% higher risk of obesity, and 19% higher risk of type 2 diabetes. The review highlights the need for a universal definition of SSBs and the importance of considering the complexity of MetS, which arises from a combination of factors, including high caloric intake, sedentary lifestyle, and central obesity. Here is a concise and clear summary of the result section:  This umbrella review systematically evaluated the available systematic reviews and meta-analyses to assess the adverse consequences of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) consumption on metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components among adults worldwide. The findings are useful for quantifying disease burden related to beverage intake and shaping health policies and interventions aimed at mitigating relevant disease risks. The evidence consistently shows that SSBs consumption is associated with MetS and its components, highlighting the need for policy interventions, nutrition policies, and regulatory strategies to enhance overall diet quality, create healthier food environments, and reduce health disparities. Reducing SSBs intake is crucial for improving dietary quality, weight management, and mitigating the risk of MetS, ultimately enhancing global health outcomes.\n",

      "Abstract: This review highlights the alarming rise of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) globally, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities, and its distinct pathogenesis, rapid progression, and severe complications. The limited treatment options are further compromised by poor response in youth. The condition is linked to structural inequities, lifestyle factors, and intergenerational transmission, as well as stigma and mental health issues. Urgent interventions are needed to prevent youth-onset T2D, enhance patient engagement, and develop targeted treatments that address the unique phenotypes and intergenerational transmission in high-risk populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intro: Here is a concise and clear summary of the intro section:  The prevalence of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (YO-T2D), diagnosed before the age of 25, is increasing globally, with an estimated 41,600 new cases in 2021. The incidence rate has increased from 117.2 to 183.4 per 100,000 population between 1990 and 2019, with higher rates in China, India, and the United States. Female youth are disproportionately affected, and delayed diagnoses may affect young males more. Pre-diabetes prevalence is also high, especially among obese adolescents. The future trajectory of YO-T2D is concerning, with worse pathophysiology, comorbidities, and treatment responses compared to later-onset diabetes, and it disproportionately affects marginalized and socioeconomically vulnerable youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Method: This study examines the complexities of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (YO-T2D), which is increasing globally, particularly among high-risk populations. The authors highlight the challenges of defining insulin resistance in youth, as adult criteria may not be applicable. They discuss the importance of considering clinical evidence of insulin resistance, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, low HDL cholesterol, and high triglycerides, as well as the role of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and pubertal insulin resistance. The study also explores the impact of intergenerational transmission of T2D, maternal malnutrition, and in-utero exposures on the risk of YO-T2D. Additionally, the authors discuss the varying phenotypes of YO-T2D, the importance of waist-to-height ratio as a marker of central adiposity, and the need for more research to better target medications to preserve or improve β-cell function in affected youth. The study emphasizes the need for effective screening strategies, particularly in high-risk populations, and the importance of individualized self-management education for youth with T2D. Here is a concise and clear summary of the method section:  The management of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (YO-T2D) requires a culturally-relevant, family-centred approach that addresses stigma, shame, and socioeconomic inequities. A combination of lifestyle modification and medications is recommended, with regular physical activity playing a crucial role in improving glycemia and reducing cardiovascular risk. Mental health, sleep, and risk behaviors should also be considered. International guidelines vary regarding glycemic targets, and youth with T2D respond differently to pharmacological management than adults. Metformin remains the first-line treatment, but there is growing awareness of the need to expand medication options, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1-RA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i). Other classes of diabetes medications are not recommended for use in YO-T2D. Metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) may also be an effective option for some youth with T2D. Pubertal stage should be considered in management decisions, as insulin resistance inherent to puberty contributes to the development of YO-T2D.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result: Here is a concise and clear summary of the result section:  YO-T2D has a more severe and aggressive phenotype than adult-onset T2D, with poorer treatment response and high risk of complications at a young age.

      "Abstract: Abstract: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 25 observational studies and 15 randomized controlled trials investigated the relationship between dietary antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related traits. The results showed that moderate dietary intakes of these antioxidants (70 mg/d of vitamin C, 12 mg/d of vitamin E, and 4 mg/d of β-carotene) were associated with a reduced risk of T2D, likely by reducing insulin resistance. However, supplementation with these antioxidants did not have a protective effect on T2D. The findings suggest that adequate, rather than high, intakes of these antioxidants may play a role in T2D prevention.\n",

      "Intro: Abstract: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a significant global health issue, affecting over 10% of the world's population. While lifestyle interventions like diet and exercise can prevent T2D, dietary patterns emphasizing plant-based foods may offer additional benefits. Antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, and β-carotene, found in these foods, may protect against T2D by reducing oxidative stress and insulin resistance. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to investigate the role of these antioxidants in T2D prevention, examining their associations with T2D incidence, insulin resistance, and β-cell function, and exploring the potential impact of smoking on these relationships.\n",

      "Method: Here is a concise and clear summary of the method section:  This study followed the PRISMA guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to July 2022 and updated in May 2023. Eligible studies were cohort, case-control, or RCT designs investigating the association between vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene and T2D incidence or insulin resistance/sensitivity. Two authors independently screened articles, extracted study information, and evaluated the risk of bias using ROBINS-I and RoB 2 tools. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models to estimate summary relative risks and 95% CIs for T2D and insulin resistance. Linear dose-response meta-analyses were also conducted to assess dietary intakes or circulating levels of vitamins C, E, and β-carotene as continuous variables. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed to detect sources of heterogeneity, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to exclude studies that did not adjust for dietary co-exposures. The GRADE framework was used to assess the certainty of evidence for each meta-analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result: This meta-analysis of 40 studies found that high dietary intakes of vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene were associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), with moderate to high certainty. The associations were nonlinear, with the lowest risk observed at moderate intakes. Circulating levels of these antioxidants also showed inverse associations with T2D, but with lower certainty. Vitamin C was found to be inversely associated with insulin resistance, while vitamin E supplementation had a beneficial effect on insulin resistance. β-Carotene was associated with improved insulin sensitivity. However, supplementation with these antioxidants did not reduce the risk of T2D, except for vitamin E's effect on insulin resistance. The findings suggest that sufficient, rather than high, intakes of these antioxidants may be important for T2D prevention. The study found that consuming a variety of fruits and vegetables and choosing unsaturated over saturated fats is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Moderate amounts of vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene may be sufficient to reduce T2D risk, with no additional benefit at higher consumption levels. However, supplementation with these antioxidants does not reduce T2D risk, possibly due to adequate dietary intakes. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms behind these associations and to determine optimal doses for different population subgroups.\n",

The Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010) and the Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3 (NRF9.3) are two DQIs that have been proposed to measure diet quality. This study aims to evaluate the association between the NRF9.3 index and the risk of developing T2DM in patients with coronary heart disease and to assess its potential as a tool to predict T2DM incidence following a dietary intervention.\n",

      "Method: Here is a concise and clear summary of the method section:  This study is a secondary analysis of the CORDIOPREV trial, a 7-year randomized controlled trial involving 1002 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) who followed either a Mediterranean diet or a low-fat diet. The study included 422 patients without type 2 diabetes (T2DM) at baseline, of which 106 developed T2DM after 5 years. Dietary data was collected using a 137-item semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire at baseline and 1-year follow-up. The nutrient density of the total diet was assessed using the Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3 (NRF9.3) score and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010). Changes in dietary quality were evaluated between baseline and 1-year follow-up. Venous blood samples were collected to measure various biomarkers, and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result: Here is a concise and clear summary of the result section:  After one year of consuming two healthy diets, patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) showed similar improvements in diet quality, as measured by the NRF9.3 score, which was associated with a lower probability of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) over 5 years. Patients who exhibited a greater improvement in NRF9.3 score had a significantly lower risk of developing T2DM compared to those with the lowest score. In contrast, changes in the AHEI-2010 score were not associated with T2DM incidence. These findings suggest that NRF9.3, a diet quality index that assesses nutrient density, may be a useful tool for predicting and reducing the risk of T2DM in patients with CHD.\n",

      "Intro: Abstract: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) pose a significant burden on global health systems and economies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. MetS, a cluster of comorbid conditions including obesity, hypertension, and disorders of carbohydrate and hyperlipidemia, has a global prevalence of 20-25% and exhibits regional variations. The pathophysiology of MetS is complex, involving factors such as caloric imbalance, sedentary lifestyles, and dietary composition. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) consumption is a primary risk factor for chronic diseases, including MetS, and has been identified as a significant contributor to its development. Despite the abundance of data on beverage consumption, there is a lack of umbrella reviews synthesizing the association between habitual SSBs consumption and MetS. This review aims to systematically and quantitatively synthesize the available meta-analysis evidence on the association between SSBs consumption and MetS in adults, highlighting novel findings and implications for guiding global health practice and policy.\n",

      "Result: This umbrella review synthesizes the evidence from 16 meta-analyses investigating the association between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its related conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. The results show a strong and consistent association between SSB consumption and an increased risk of MetS and its related conditions. The pooled analysis indicates that the highest versus lowest SSB consumption is associated with a 29% increased risk of MetS, 18% increased risk of obesity, 12% increased risk of hypertension, and 29% increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The dose-response analysis reveals that each increment of one serving/day of SSBs is associated with a 9% higher risk of hypertension, 18% higher risk of obesity, and 19% higher risk of type 2 diabetes. The review highlights the need for a universal definition of SSBs and the importance of considering the complexity of MetS, which arises from a combination of factors, including high caloric intake, sedentary lifestyle, and central obesity.

The incidence rate has increased from 117.2 to 183.4 per 100,000 population between 1990 and 2019, with higher rates in China, India, and the United States. Female youth are disproportionately affected, and delayed diagnoses may affect young males more. Pre-diabetes prevalence is also high, especially among obese adolescents.

      "Method: This study examines the complexities of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (YO-T2D), which is increasing globally, particularly among high-risk populations. The authors highlight the challenges of defining insulin resistance in youth, as adult criteria may not be applicable. They discuss the importance of considering clinical evidence of insulin resistance, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, low HDL cholesterol, and high triglycerides, as well as the role of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and pubertal insulin resistance. The study also explores the impact of intergenerational transmission of T2D, maternal malnutrition, and in-utero exposures on the risk of YO-T2D. Additionally, the authors discuss the varying phenotypes of YO-T2D, the importance of waist-to-height ratio as a marker of central adiposity, and the need for more research to better target medications to preserve or improve β-cell function in affected youth. The study emphasizes the need for effective screening strategies, particularly in high-risk populations, and the importance of individualized self-management education for youth with T2D. Here is a concise and clear summary of the method section:  The management of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (YO-T2D) requires a culturally-relevant, family-centred approach that addresses stigma, shame, and socioeconomic inequities. A combination of lifestyle modification and medications is recommended, with regular physical activity playing a crucial role in improving glycemia and reducing cardiovascular risk. Mental health, sleep, and risk behaviors should also be considered. International guidelines vary regarding glycemic targets, and youth with T2D respond differently to pharmacological management than adults. Metformin remains the first-line treatment, but there is growing awareness of the need to expand medication options, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1-RA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i). Other classes of diabetes medications are not recommended for use in YO-T2D. Metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) may also be an effective option for some youth with T2D. Pubertal stage should be considered in management decisions, as insulin resistance inherent to puberty contributes to the development of YO-T2D.\n",

Vitamin C was found to be inversely associated with insulin resistance, while vitamin E supplementation had a beneficial effect on insulin resistance. β-Carotene was associated with improved insulin sensitivity. However, supplementation with these antioxidants did not reduce the risk of T2D, except for vitamin E's effect on insulin resistance. The findings suggest that sufficient, rather than high, intakes of these antioxidants may be important for T2D prevention. The study found that consuming a variety of fruits and vegetables and choosing unsaturated over saturated fats is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Moderate amounts of vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene may be sufficient to reduce T2D risk, with no additional benefit at higher consumption levels.

      "Here is a summary of the Methods section:  This study is part of the CORDIOPREV trial, a randomized controlled trial that included 1002 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) who followed one of two healthy diets (Mediterranean or low-fat) for 7 years. The patients were recruited from hospitals in Cordoba and Jaen, Spain, between 2009 and 2012. Inclusion criteria included patients aged 20-75 years with established CHD, no clinical events in the last 6 months, and no other serious illnesses. A total of 422 patients without type 2 diabetes (T2DM) at the beginning of the study were included, with 106 developing T2DM after 5 years (incident-T2DM group) and 316 not developing T2DM (non-T2DM group).  Dietary data was collected using a validated 137-item semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline and 1-year follow-up. The nutrient density of the total diet was assessed using the NRF9.3 score, which is based on 12 nutrients: 9 to encourage and 3 to limit. The NRF9.3 score was calculated by adjusting daily intake of each nutrient for 2000 kcal and expressing it as a percentage of the reference daily value. Additionally, dietary quality was assessed using the AHEI-2010, which consists of 11 dietary factors predictive of chronic diseases.  Changes in dietary quality over time were evaluated using the ∆NRF9.3 and ∆AHEI2010 scores. The study also analyzed anthropometric, lipid, and glucose variables, as well as insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance indices. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0, and differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.\n",

      "Here is a summary of the \"Methods\" section of the paper:  This study enrolled 120 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) from Beijing Hepingli Hospital between January 2021 and June 2022. The patients were divided into two groups: AIS + T2DM (n = 62) and T2DM (n = 58) based on the presence or absence of a history of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The diagnosis of T2DM was made according to the 2010 American Diabetes Association Classification, and AIS was diagnosed based on clinical signs, symptoms, and imaging results. Patients with brain surgery, hemorrhagic stroke, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and serious infections were excluded.  Blood samples were collected from the antecubital vein after a 10-hour fast within the first 24 hours of admission. Serum and plasma were obtained by centrifugation, and various biochemical parameters, including lipid profiles, glucose, and inflammatory markers, were measured using automated analyzers and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits.  Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS20.0 and GraphPad Prism 9. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate risk factors for AIS in T2DM patients. The diagnostic accuracy of hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 on AIS in T2DM patients was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and area under the curve (AUC). The cutoff values for each risk factor in AIS diagnosis were determined using the Youden method. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Hepingli Hospital, and written informed consents were obtained from all participants before the study began.\n",

      "Here is a summary of the Methods section:  This umbrella review aimed to investigate the associations between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and various health outcomes. A comprehensive search of four electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, MedRxiv, and Epistemonikos) was conducted to identify relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The search strategy employed predetermined search keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms to identify studies that explored the relationships between SSB consumption and health outcomes, including metabolic syndrome conditions.  Eligible studies were required to have a minimum follow-up period of one year, report associations between SSB consumption and health outcomes, and include participants aged 18 years or older with no exclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the included reviews was evaluated using the AMSTAR 2 checklist, and the associations between SSB consumption and health outcomes were classified into four evidence groups based on the significance of the associations.  Data extraction was conducted by three independent researchers in a blinded fashion, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a fourth reviewer. The meta-analyses were recalculated using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model, and statistical heterogeneity and publication bias were examined using the I2 statistic, Cochrane's Q test, and Egger's regression test. The protocol for this review was prospectively registered and adhered to the PRISMA guidelines.\n",

      "Here is a summary of the Methods section of the paper:  This section of the paper discusses the complexities of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (YO-T2D) and its management. The authors highlight the importance of considering pubertal stage, intergenerational transmission of T2D, and the role of micronutrients in YO-T2D pathogenesis. They also explore the relationship between maternal hyperglycemia, obesity, and the risk of T2D in offspring, citing studies that demonstrate the additive effect of these factors. The authors emphasize the need for further research into the timing of critical periods for exposure to hyperglycemia, the impact of co-existing intrauterine factors, and the effect of T2D treatment on future risk.  Additionally, the authors discuss the increased risk of complications in YO-T2D, including diabetic kidney disease, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, which are often present at diagnosis and worsen over time. They cite studies that demonstrate the higher risk of complications in YO-T2D compared to T1D and later-onset T2D, underscoring the need for early intervention and prevention strategies.  Overall, this section emphasizes the complexity of YO-T2D and the need for tailored approaches to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The authors highlight the importance of considering the unique characteristics and needs of this population, including the role of pubertal stage, intergenerational transmission, and micronutrients in disease pathogenesis.\n",

      "Here is a summary of the Methods section:  This review employed the Arksey and O'Malley methodology, a comprehensive approach to mapping existing literature. The process began with formulating research questions based on the introductory section. A thorough literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed, NCBI, Science Direct, and Springer Link, with keywords related to childhood obesity and early-onset diabetes mellitus. The search was restricted to publications between 2001 and 2021 to focus on up-to-date research.  The inclusion criteria consisted of primary research, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses conducted in English, addressing the relationships between childhood obesity and early-onset diabetes mellitus. Duplicate entries were removed, and each piece of literature underwent title and abstract screening to select studies for full-text review. The selected studies were further evaluated for final inclusion.  Data extraction was categorized into eight sections, including authors, publication year, study location, research design, study population characteristics, research objectives, conclusions, and interventions. The findings were summarized, synthesized, and reported using various analytical methods, including frequency and percentage presentations. The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 1, highlighting key details such as study design and publication year. This systematic approach ensured a comprehensive review of existing literature on childhood obesity and early-onset diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "Here is a summary of the Methods section:  This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the association between dietary intakes, circulating levels, or supplementation of vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene and type 2 diabetes (T2D) incidence or insulin resistance/sensitivity and β-cell function. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to July 2022 and updated in May 2023. Eligible studies included cohort, case-control, nested case-control, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the relationship between vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene and T2D incidence or insulin resistance/sensitivity and β-cell function in individuals who were diabetes-free at baseline.  Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and full-text versions of potentially eligible articles were examined. Disagreements were resolved through consultation with a third author. Study information was extracted, including study design, data collection year, country, cohort name, number of participants, and outcome assessment methods. The Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool and the revised tool for Risk of Bias in Randomized Trials (RoB 2) were used to evaluate the risk of bias in individual studies.  Summary relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for T2D were estimated using a random-effects model. Linear dose-response meta-analyses were performed to assess dietary intakes or circulating levels of vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene as continuous variables. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework was used to assess the certainty of evidence for each meta-analysis.\n",

[ 8, 21, 22 ] a meta - analysis provided evidence that elevated levels of hs - crp were associated with ischemic but not hemorrhagic stroke. [ 8 ] these findings suggested an essential relationship between hs - crp level and ischemic stroke. however, there are very few studies focus on the risk of plasma hs - crp levels and stroke in type 2 diabetic patients. for example, anne gedebjerg et al has reported that high ( > 3mg / l ) hs - crp was associated with increased cardiovascular events risk ( ahr 1. 45, 95 % ci : 1. 07 1. 96 ) and with even greater risk of all - cause mortality ( 2. 47, 1. 88 – 3. 25 ) when compared with patients with low ( < 1mg / l ) hs - crp.

[ 24 ] these findings were partially in accordance with our findings that elevated plasma hs - crp level was an independent risk factor for ais in t2dm patients. the mechanism underlying the positive relationship between increased hs - crp level and higher ischemic stroke risk is not yet established. it might be that atherosclerosis is the most common underlying cause of ischemic stroke, whereas a chronic inflammatory response is directly involved in the development of atherosclerosis.

The findings suggest that improved diet quality, as measured by NRF9.3, is associated with a lower risk of T2DM.  **Introduction:** The increasing incidence of T2DM in Western countries highlights the need for nutritional interventions promoting high-quality dietary patterns. This study aims to investigate whether changes in NRF9.3 are related to the risk of developing T2DM in patients with CHD.  **Methods:** The study was conducted within the context of two healthy dietary interventions (Mediterranean and low-fat diets) using data from the CORDIOPREV study. Patients without T2DM at baseline were evaluated, and NRF9.3 scores were calculated using Food Frequency Questionnaires at baseline and after 1 year of intervention.  **Results:** After 5 years of follow-up, 106 patients developed T2DM, while 316 did not. The results showed that patients with greater improvement in NRF9.3 had over 50% less risk of developing T2DM compared to the lowest tertile (HR 2.10, 95% CI = 1.12\\u20133.56). Incident-T2DM patients showed less improvement in NRF9.3 than non-T2DM patients (p = 0.010).  Overall, this study suggests that improving diet quality in terms of nutrient density after dietary intervention is associated with a lower risk of T2DM in patients with CHD.\"\n",

The study measured various biomarkers in blood samples, including serum uric acid, homocysteine, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin A1c, and lipids. The results showed that levels of fasting blood glucose, homocysteine, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) were significantly higher in the T2DM + AIS group compared to the T2DM group.  Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 were independent risk factors for AIS development in T2DM patients, with odds ratios of 2.85 and 3.64, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that plasma hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 had good predictive performance for AIS occurrence in T2DM patients, with areas under the curve of 0.749 and 0.791, respectively. The optimal concentration cutoff points for hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 were 3.38 mg/L and 204.2 ng/mL, respectively. Overall, the study suggests that plasma hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 are potential biomarkers for AIS risk in T2DM patients.\"\n",

The review identified 16 eligible meta-analyses, yielding 30 summary estimates for the impact of SSBs consumption on obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and MetS.  The findings suggest an increased risk of 18%, 12%, 29%, and 29% for obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and MetS, respectively, when comparing the highest and lowest levels of SSBs consumption. The review's results support the need for rigorous policy interventions to reduce SSBs consumption and alleviate the global burden of MetS. The evidence suggests that SSBs are a significant risk factor for the development of MetS and its related conditions.  Notably, the review highlights the lack of consensus on specific criteria to identify studies related to SSBs in literature searching, emphasizing the need for standardized criteria.

The incidence and prevalence of youth-onset T2D are increasing globally, disproportionately affecting First Nations communities, socioeconomically disadvantaged youth, and people of color. Notably, youth-onset T2D differs from later-onset T2D in its pathogenesis and progresses more rapidly, leading to earlier complications. Available treatment options are limited, and response to medications is poorer in youth with T2D.  The rising prevalence and severity of youth-onset T2D are attributed to multiple interacting factors, including structural inequities, increasing obesity and sedentary lifestyles, and intergenerational transmission from in-utero exposure to maternal hyperglycemia and obesity. Moreover, youth-onset T2D is associated with stigma and poorer mental health, which impact clinical management. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective interventions to prevent youth-onset T2D and enhance engagement of affected youth. Additionally, understanding the differing phenotypes of youth-onset T2D is critical to effectively target treatments and address intergenerational transmission in high-risk populations.  Overall, this review highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to address the growing burden of youth-onset T2D, including the development of targeted interventions and a better understanding of the underlying pathogenesis and phenotypes of this disease.\"\n",

The study identified 25 prospective observational studies and 15 randomized controlled trials that met the eligibility criteria through a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. The results revealed inverse associations between dietary and circulating antioxidants and T2D, with the lowest risk observed at moderate intakes of 70 mg/d of vitamin C, 12 mg/d of vitamin E, and 4 mg/d of \\u03b2-carotene. Notably, supplementation with vitamin E or \\u03b2-carotene did not demonstrate a protective effect on T2D. However, higher dietary vitamin C and vitamin E supplementation were associated with reduced insulin resistance. The certainty of evidence was high for the associations between T2D and dietary vitamin E and \\u03b2-carotene, and low to moderate for other associations.

The World Health Organization reports a significant increase in T2DM prevalence since 2014, with obesity, unhealthy diets, and overweight being major risk factors. Conversely, adhering to high-quality dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, has been shown to prevent T2DM incidence. Other diets emphasizing nutrient-dense plant-based foods, like the DASH diet and vegetarian diets, have also been associated with lower T2DM risk.  The concept of diet quality is introduced, with the nutrient density of a diet being a good indicator of diet quality. Several diet quality indices (DQIs) have been proposed, including the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010) and the Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3 (NRF9.3). The NRF9.3 index, which considers both macronutrients and micronutrients, is suggested as a promising tool to measure diet quality and predict disease risk.  The study's objective is to investigate the association between the NRF9.3 index and the risk of developing T2DM in patients with coronary heart disease, as well as its potential as a predictor of T2DM incidence following dietary intervention.

In fact, T2DM is recognized as a risk factor for IS beyond conventional risk factors such as blood pressure, smoking habits, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The importance of controlling diabetes in reducing the risk and severity of first-time stroke is emphasized, as optimal glycemic control has been shown to lower the risk of recurrent stroke in diabetic patients. The role of inflammation in the development of atherosclerosis and IS is also highlighted, with elevated inflammation associated with poor stroke outcome in diabetic patients. Specifically, two inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), have been linked to IS risk and poor functional outcome.

The underlying mechanisms leading to YO-T2D involve both insulin resistance and pancreatic \\u03b2-cell dysfunction. The stage of puberty at diagnosis and intergenerational transmission of T2D also play a crucial role in understanding risk factors, pathogenesis, and complications. Additionally, micronutrient sufficiency and the in-utero environment, particularly exposure to maternal obesity, nutrient imbalance, and hyperglycemia, are important considerations.  The management of YO-T2D requires a comprehensive approach, taking into account the unique challenges and considerations of this population.

Furthermore, the study found that patients with incident T2DM had lower NRF9.3 scores, indicating a lower intake of beneficial nutrients and/or a higher consumption of deleterious nutrients relative to total energy intake. Importantly, improvements in NRF9.3 score were associated with a lower probability of developing T2DM. Specifically, patients who exhibited a greater improvement in NRF9.3 score had a significantly lower probability of developing T2DM compared to those with the lowest NRF9.3 score.

Specifically, levels of fasting blood glucose, homocysteine, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) were significantly higher in the T2DM + AIS group.  Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 as independent risk factors for AIS in T2DM patients, with odds ratios of 2.85 and 3.64, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that plasma hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 had good predictive performance for AIS occurrence in T2DM patients, with areas under the curve of 0.749 and 0.791, respectively. The optimal concentration cutoff points of hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 were 3.38 mg/L and 204.2 ng/mL, respectively.  These findings suggest that hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 are potential biomarkers for risk stratification of AIS in T2DM patients.

The pooled analysis reveals a 29% increased risk of MetS, 18% increased risk of obesity, 29% increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and 12% increased risk of hypertension with highest versus lowest SSB consumption. The quality assessment of the included meta-analyses shows that seven studies had high methodological quality, while nine studies had moderate or low quality. No evidence of publication bias was found.  The findings of this review align with existing literature, which consistently shows a positive association between SSB consumption and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, partly mediated by weight gain and independent metabolic pathways. SSB consumption is also an independent risk factor for hypertension, partially mediated by changes in weight. Despite methodological discrepancies, the study's findings are consistent with previous research on the association between SSB consumption and MetS.  The study acknowledges its limitations, including the heterogeneous nature of the evidence, reliance on included meta-analyses, and restricted search approach. Nevertheless, the findings are useful for quantifying disease burden related to beverage intake and shaping health policies and interventions aimed at mitigating relevant disease risks. The study concludes by emphasizing the need for coordinated actions to prioritize prevention of chronic diseases such as MetS, and recommends future research focus on examining the effects of various SSBs on health outcomes across a wide range of doses, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.\"\n",

This condition is associated with poorer treatment outcomes and a higher risk of diabetes-related complications at a young age. The distinct pathophysiology of YO-T2D highlights the need for a better understanding of risk factors, phenotypes, and effective prevention and treatment strategies. Notably, YO-T2D disproportionately affects socioeconomically disadvantaged youth, and intergenerational transmission in high-risk communities may exacerbate health inequities. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop innovative models of care that effectively engage youth with T2D and holistically improve their mental health and wellbeing.\"\n",

The studies reviewed report varying prevalence rates of obesity among this population, ranging from 58.4% in Bangladesh to 81.1% in Europe. Regional differences in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus among obese children are also noted, with lower rates reported in Africa compared to the United States.   The review identifies several risk factors associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, including family history, obesity, lifestyle, and dietary habits. Obesity is found to play a crucial role in the development of insulin resistance, leading to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Early detection of diabetes mellitus is highlighted as carrying a lower long-term risk compared to remaining undiagnosed.  The majority of the reviewed studies were cross-sectional, which limits the establishment of a cause-and-effect relationship between childhood obesity and early-onset diabetes mellitus. The review emphasizes the need for further research using experimental, retrospective, and prospective designs to establish the temporal sequence of disease development. Additionally, it is essential to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus to better understand their distinct characteristics.\"\n",

The results showed that moderate dietary intakes of these antioxidants were associated with a reduced risk of T2D, with moderate to high certainty. Specifically, vitamin C was found to be inversely associated with T2D, with a 24% lower risk at an intake of 70 mg/d, while vitamin E and \\u03b2-carotene were associated with a 28% and 22% lower risk, respectively, at intakes of 12 mg/d and 4 mg/d. However, the RCTs did not support a protective effect of supplementation with these antioxidants on T2D risk, apart from a protective effect of vitamin E supplementation on insulin resistance. The study's findings suggest that sufficient rather than high intakes of these antioxidants may be important for diabetes prevention, and that the mechanism may involve improved insulin sensitivity. Notably, the study found that smokers may benefit from higher intakes of vitamin C and vitamin E, and highlighted the importance of understanding the mechanisms and optimal thresholds of different antioxidants.\"\n",

      "Here is a summary of the provided text passages, broken down into the main sections of the paper:  **Diet and Lifestyle: Saturated Fat**  This study examines the relationship between changes in Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3 (NRF9.3) and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). The findings suggest that improved diet quality, as measured by NRF9.3, is associated with a lower risk of T2DM. The study was conducted within the context of two healthy dietary interventions (Mediterranean and low-fat diets) using data from the CORDIOPREV study. After 5 years of follow-up, patients with greater improvement in NRF9.3 had over 50% less risk of developing T2DM compared to the lowest tertile.  **Epigenetics: Histone Acetylation**  This study investigated the risk factors for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The results showed that levels of fasting blood glucose, homocysteine, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) were significantly higher in the T2DM + AIS group compared to the T2DM group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 were independent risk factors for AIS development in T2DM patients.  **Diet and Lifestyle: Overweight, Obesity, High Fat Level, and Large Waist Circumference**  This umbrella review aims to synthesize the evidence linking habitual sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) intake with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in adults. The findings suggest an increased risk of 18%, 12%, 29%, and 29% for obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and MetS, respectively, when comparing the highest and lowest levels of SSBs consumption. The review supports the need for rigorous policy interventions to reduce SSBs consumption and alleviate the global burden of MetS.  **Environmental Pollutants: Air Pollutants**  This review aims to explore the emerging evidence on youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D), including its pathogenesis, future trajectories, treatment options, and phenotypes. The incidence and prevalence of youth-onset T2D are increasing globally, disproportionately affecting First Nations communities, socioeconomically disadvantaged youth, and people of color. The review highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to address the growing burden of youth-onset T2D.  **Diet and Lifestyle: Physical Inactivity**  This scoping review investigates the relationship between childhood obesity and early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus, exploring contributing factors such as family history, gender, sedentary lifestyle, poor dietary habits, and insulin resistance in adipose tissue. The review highlights factors contributing to type 2 diabetes mellitus development, including obesity development, hypertension, and unfavorable lipid profiles.  **Diet and Lifestyle: Smoking**  This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the relationship between dietary antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well as related traits. The results revealed inverse associations between dietary and circulating antioxidants and T2D, with the lowest risk observed at moderate intakes of these antioxidants. The findings suggest that moderate intakes of these antioxidants may lower the risk of T2D by reducing insulin resistance.\n",
      "intro\n",
      "Here is a summary of the Introduction sections of the papers, grouped by main theme and sub-theme:  **Main Theme: Diet and Lifestyle**  **Sub Theme: Saturated Fat**  The introduction highlights the growing concern of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), a chronic disease characterized by abnormal carbohydrate metabolism. Diets high in saturated fats contribute to insulin resistance, while adhering to high-quality dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, can prevent T2DM incidence. The study's objective is to investigate the association between the Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3 (NRF9.3) and the risk of developing T2DM in patients with coronary heart disease.  **Sub Theme: Overweight, Obesity, High Fat Level, Large Waist Circumference**  Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) pose a significant burden on global health systems and economies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The emerging metabolic syndrome (MetS) incidence exacerbates this burden, characterized by a cluster of comorbid conditions including obesity, hypertension, and disorders of carbohydrate and hyperlipidemia. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) consumption has been identified as a primary risk factor for chronic diseases, including MetS.  **Sub Theme: Physical Inactivity**  Childhood obesity has become a significant public health concern in the 21st century, with nearly half of the world's children expected to be affected by 2020. The determinants of excessive weight gain in children are similar to those in adults, including genetic predisposition, environmental influences, dietary patterns, and individual behaviors. Childhood obesity is linked to a rise in comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and liver disorders.  **Sub Theme: Smoking**  Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a significant global health issue affecting over 10% of the world's population. Lifestyle interventions, particularly diet and exercise, are crucial in preventing T2D in high-risk individuals. Beyond weight loss, dietary interventions have been shown to reduce the risk of T2D, as evidenced by prospective studies on healthy dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension diets.  **Main Theme: Epigenetics**  **Sub Theme: Histone Acetylation**  The introduction highlights the significant burden of ischemic stroke (IS) worldwide, which accounts for over 80% of stroke cases and is a leading cause of mortality and adult disability. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at a higher risk of developing IS compared to those without T2DM. The study's objective is to investigate the risk factors associated with inflammation for acute ischemic stroke in patients with T2DM.  **Main Theme: Environmental Pollutants**  **Sub Theme: Air Pollutants**  Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (YO-T2D), diagnosed before the age of 25, is a growing global health concern. The incidence of YO-T2D is increasing worldwide, with an estimated 41,600 new cases in 2021. Pre-diabetes prevalence is also alarmingly high, with nearly 20% of adolescents in the United States having pre-diabetes. This review aims to explore the emerging evidence regarding the pathogenesis, future trajectories, treatment options, and phenotypes of YO-T2D.\n",
      "methods\n",
      "Here are the summaries of the Methods sections for each theme:  **Main Theme: Diet and Lifestyle** **Sub Theme: Saturated Fat**  The CORDIOPREV study, a randomized controlled trial, enrolled 1002 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) who followed either a Mediterranean or low-fat diet for 7 years. From this cohort, 462 patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at baseline were selected for analysis. Dietary data were collected using a validated 137-item semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline and 1-year follow-up. The nutrient density of the total diet was assessed using the Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3 (NRF9.3) score, and dietary quality was evaluated using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010).  **Main Theme: Epigenetics** **Sub Theme: Histone acetylation**  This study recruited 120 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from Beijing Hepingli Hospital between January 2021 and June 2022. Patients were divided into two groups: AIS + T2DM (n = 62) and T2DM (n = 58) based on the presence or absence of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Blood samples were collected within 24 hours of admission, and various biochemical parameters were measured using standardized laboratory methods. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and GraphPad Prism software.  **Main Theme: Diet and Lifestyle** **Sub Theme: overweight, obesity, high fat level, large waist circumference**  This systematic review and meta-analysis employed a rigorous methodology to examine the associations between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and various health outcomes. A comprehensive search of four electronic databases and a manual review of reference lists were conducted to identify eligible studies. The inclusion criteria were stringent, and studies had to provide precise data for computing summary effect sizes, 95% confidence intervals, and corresponding numbers of cases and population.  **Main Theme: Environmental Pollutants** **Sub Theme: Air Pollutants**  The diagnosis and management of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (YO-T2D) are complex and challenging. Simple measures of insulin resistance are inadequate, and adult criteria for pre-diabetes may not be applicable to youth. The authors highlight the importance of considering clinical evidence of insulin resistance and suggest that potentially lower HbA1c cut-offs may be needed to define pre-diabetes in youth with overweight/obesity.  **Main Theme: Diet and Lifestyle** **Sub Theme: Physical Inactivity**  This review employed the Arksey and O'Malley review methodology, a comprehensive approach to mapping existing literature. A database search was conducted using keywords related to childhood obesity and early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus, restricted to publications between 2001 and 2021.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted in three major databases from inception to July 2022 and updated in May 2023. The search focused on cohort, case-control, and RCT designs that examined the association between dietary intakes, circulating levels, or supplementation of vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene and T2D incidence or insulin resistance/sensitivity and β-cell function in diabetes-free individuals.\n",

      "Here is the refined research survey:   abstract This research survey examines the relationship between various factors and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including the association between improved diet quality and T2DM risk in patients with coronary heart disease, risk factors for acute ischemic stroke in patients with T2DM, the link between sugar-sweetened beverages intake and metabolic syndrome, and the emerging evidence on youth-onset type 2 diabetes.  introduction Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease characterized by abnormal carbohydrate metabolism, with diets high in saturated fats contributing to insulin resistance, while high-quality dietary patterns can prevent T2DM incidence. Non-communicable diseases pose a significant burden on global health systems and economies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, with childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes being significant global health concerns.  method The study employed a randomized controlled trial, a systematic review and meta-analysis, and a scoping review. The CORDIOPREV study enrolled 1002 patients with coronary heart disease who followed either a Mediterranean or low-fat diet for 7 years. Dietary data were collected using a validated food-frequency questionnaire, and blood samples were collected to measure biochemical parameters. A comprehensive search of electronic databases and a manual review of reference lists were conducted to identify eligible studies.  results The study found significant differences in baseline characteristics between patients with incident T2DM and non-T2DM patients, with improvements in NRF9.3 score associated with a lower probability of developing T2DM. The study also identified hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 as independent risk factors for AIS in T2DM patients. A significant association was found between SSB consumption and an increased risk of MetS, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. The literature review examined the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents, and a meta-analysis found that moderate dietary intakes of antioxidants were associated with a reduced risk of T2D.  results **Diet and Lifestyle: Saturated Fat** The study found significant differences in baseline characteristics between patients with incident T2DM and non-T2DM patients. Patients with incident T2DM had higher values of BMI, waist circumference, HOMA-IR, HbA1c, fasting insulin, and glucose levels compared to non-T2DM patients. Conversely, TG, DI, IGI, and ISI were lower in incident T2DM patients. Improvements in NRF9.3 score were associated with a lower probability of developing T2DM.  results **Epigenetics: Histone Acetylation** The study revealed no significant differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between patients with T2DM and those with T2DM and AIS. However, biochemical characteristics differed significantly between the two groups. Levels of fasting blood glucose, homocysteine, hs-CRP, and Lp-PLA2 were significantly higher in the T2DM + AIS group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 as independent risk factors for AIS in T2DM patients.  results **Diet and Lifestyle: Overweight, Obesity, High Fat Level, Large Waist Circumference** The systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated a significant association between SSB consumption and an increased risk of MetS, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. The pooled analysis revealed a 29% increased risk of MetS, 18% increased risk of obesity, 29% increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and 12% increased risk of hypertension with highest versus lowest SSB consumption.  results **Diet and Lifestyle: Physical Inactivity** The literature review examined the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus among children and adolescents. The studies reviewed reported varying prevalence rates of obesity among this population, ranging from 58.4% in Bangladesh to 81.1% in Europe. Regional differences in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus among obese children were also noted, with lower rates reported in Africa compared to the United States.  results **Diet and Lifestyle: Smoking** The meta-analysis examined the relationship between antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene) and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in 40 studies. The results showed that moderate dietary intakes of these antioxidants were associated with a reduced risk of T2D, with moderate to high certainty. Specifically, vitamin C was found to be inversely associated with T2D, with a 24% lower risk at an intake of 70 mg/d, while vitamin E and β-carotene were associated with a 28% and 22% lower risk, respectively, at intakes of 12 mg/d and 4 mg/d.\n",
      "resultsHere are the summaries of the \"Results\" sections:  **Diet and Lifestyle: Saturated Fat**  The study found significant differences in baseline characteristics between patients with incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and non-T2DM patients. Patients with incident T2DM had higher values of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting insulin, and glucose levels compared to non-T2DM patients. Conversely, triglycerides (TG), disposition index (DI), insulinogenic index (IGI), and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) were lower in incident T2DM patients. Improvements in NRF9.3 score, a measure of beneficial nutrient intake, were associated with a lower probability of developing T2DM.  **Epigenetics: Histone Acetylation**  The study revealed no significant differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and those with T2DM and acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, biochemical characteristics differed significantly between the two groups. Levels of fasting blood glucose, homocysteine, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) were significantly higher in the T2DM + AIS group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 as independent risk factors for AIS in T2DM patients.  **Diet and Lifestyle: Overweight, Obesity, High Fat Level, Large Waist Circumference**  The systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated a significant association between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. The pooled analysis revealed a 29% increased risk of MetS, 18% increased risk of obesity, 29% increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and 12% increased risk of hypertension with highest versus lowest SSB consumption.  **Environmental Pollutants: Air Pollutants**  Unfortunately, the Results section was not provided.  **Diet and Lifestyle: Physical Inactivity**  The literature review examined the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus among children and adolescents.

      "Here is a conclusion summarizing the study:  In conclusion, this study demonstrates the importance of diet quality in preventing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in patients with coronary heart disease. The Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3 (NRF9.3) was found to be a reliable tool in measuring diet quality and predicting T2DM incidence. Patients who showed greater improvement in NRF9.3 had a significantly lower risk of developing T2DM. These findings highlight the need for dietary interventions that focus on nutrient-dense foods to prevent T2DM and support the use of NRF9.3 as a valuable tool in assessing diet quality.\n",
      "Here is a conclusion summarizing the study:  In conclusion, this study investigated the risk factors associated with inflammation for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The results showed that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) are independent risk factors for AIS in T2DM patients, with good predictive performance. These findings provide a basis for the prevention and treatment of stroke in diabetic patients, highlighting the importance of controlling diabetes and inflammation to reduce the risk and severity of AIS.\n",
      "Here is a conclusion summarizing the above information:  This umbrella review synthesizes the evidence on the association between sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) consumption and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in adults. The results show that high SSBs consumption is associated with an 18-29% increased risk of obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and MetS, with predominantly high-quality evidence. The findings highlight the importance of reducing SSBs intake to promote better health outcomes, supporting the World Health Organization's recommendations. This review emphasizes the need for public health strategies to limit SSBs consumption and prevent MetS, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.\n",
      "Here is a conclusion summarizing the above information:  Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (YO-T2D) is a growing global health concern, with increasing incidence rates worldwide. Female youth are disproportionately affected, while delayed diagnoses may affect young males. Pre-diabetes prevalence is alarmingly high, with risk factors including obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and ethnicity. This review aims to explore the pathogenesis, future trajectories, treatment options, and phenotypes of YO-T2D, focusing on identifying high-risk youth, developing effective prevention interventions, and addressing intergenerational transmission in high-risk populations.\n",
      "Here is a conclusion summarizing the above information:  In conclusion, childhood obesity is a significant public health concern linked to early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our study found that physical inactivity, among other factors, contributes to the development of insulin resistance, hypertension, and unfavorable lipid profiles, ultimately leading to type 2 diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus is alarming, with projected estimates reaching 552 million by 2023. Urgent attention is needed to address the root causes of childhood obesity and promote healthy lifestyle habits to prevent the onset of this debilitating disease.\n",
      "Here is a conclusion summarizing the above information:  In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis found that dietary and circulating antioxidants, particularly vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene, are inversely associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. Optimal intakes of 70 mg/d vitamin C, 12 mg/d vitamin E, and 4 mg/d β-carotene were found to be protective. However, supplementation with vitamin E or β-carotene did not show a protective effect. These findings highlight the importance of a balanced diet rich in antioxidants in preventing type 2 diabetes, and support the need for further research on the specific mechanisms and optimal doses of these antioxidants.\n"
